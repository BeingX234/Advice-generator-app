## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Transition and transform properties (To make it more cooler! I guess?)
- Flexbox
- Simple fetching data from API function

### What I learned

- Learned how to use Javascript for fetching data from API.

- Learned about the basics of transition and transform in CSS.


### Continued development

- Maybe this is just a simple project but I did the best I could do (atleast for now). It's fun to know more about Javascript and the transition/transformation in CSS. There are still a lot of things I need to learn more, especially the Javascript and sure I will have to remember more HTML tags and CSS properties (still needed to google a lot when coding)
